    "Prof. Smith is rolling up a new character for her optimization-based role-playing campaign and she wants to use linear programming to help make some important decisions. She is playing a 4th-level Dragonborn and is trying to decide how many pounds of iron and steel she wants to use to build a sword. Every pound of steel adds a \"slowness\" factor of 1, whereas every pound of iron adds a \"slowness\" factor of -3 (reduces slowness by 3). She would like to combine iron and steel to meet the requirements given below while minimizing the total \"slowness\" of her character. \n",

MineCo can extract up to 1000 total tons today.\n",
